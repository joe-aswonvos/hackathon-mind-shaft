## Features and Functionality

### Models
MindShaft leverages Django's ORM to define data models for the application:
1. **Deck**: Represents a collection of flashcards under a specific topic or category.
    - Fields: `name`, `description`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
2. **Card**: Represents an individual flashcard with a front (question) and a back (answer).
    - Fields: `question`, `answer`, `deck`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

### Pages and Interaction
The following pages provide seamless interaction with the system:
1. **Home Page**:
    - Overview of the application with navigation links to decks and study modes.
2. **Decks Page**:
    - Users can create, view, and delete decks.
3. **Flashcard Management**:
    - Add flashcards to decks and edit/delete them as necessary.
4. **Study Mode**:
    - Review deck contents in a user-friendly interface.
    - Optional features: shuffle cards, mark as learned, etc.
5. **Admin Dashboard**:
    - Django-admin to manage the database manually (for advanced users).

### Interaction Diagram
The interaction between models, pages, and the database can be visualized as follows:
1. **Deck <> Card Relationship**: Each deck contains multiple cards (One-To-Many).
2. **User Interaction**: User actions on pages update models and reflect in the database.
